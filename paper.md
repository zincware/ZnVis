# Summary

Visualisation of complex particle interactions is essential in the design of novel materials, programming of robots, and general study of mechanical processes.
While the majority of science is performed using the Python programming language, there is yet to be a suitable Python-interfaced visualisation tool that can handle large systems, interactive visualisation, and powerful rendering.
ZnVis has been developed to address this gap in the community by interfacing between several lower-level packages including Open3D and Mitsuba.
With ZnVis, users can perform complex simulations, interactively visualize their results, and then create high-definition, ray-traced renderings of frames or entire videos.
While ZnVis has been developed alongside tools and simulations for reinforcement-learning controlled microrobots, we are confident that the easy-to-use interface and powerful capabilities can serve the community well.
